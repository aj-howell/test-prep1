# test-prep1

For this code the developer team used one file and one version to ensure that the program still worked. We also removed all white space and most of our classes and functions are in one file. In our getters and setters we set the names to a constant value. This was all done in one go, there was now way of documenting edits and we currently have no trace of the original document. Also we did not practice defensive programming nor did we run every function after making them. We just coded everything in one go. We changed our variable names a few times but that was it. We hope that you love our project because we do.
